# WHERE'S THE HELPER NODE!?!?!

Don't panic, it has moved to a new home!

# WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!?!

When I first started the "helpernode", it was to help me learn/install OpenShift 4. It has since then grown to actually start being useful to others.

To help it grow beyond it's initial intention, I need more eyes/brains on the project.

# HOW DO I CONRTIBUTE!?!

Take a look at the [contribuing](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/ocp4-helpernode/blob/master/docs/contribute.md) page!
