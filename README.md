# OCP4 UPI Helper Node Playbook

> You can visit the [quickstart](docs/quickstart.md) to get right on it and start

This assumes the following

1. You're on a Network that has access to the internet
2. The network you're on does NOT have DHCP
3. The helpernode will be your LB/DHCP/PXE/DNS and HTTPD server
4. You still have to do the OpenShift Install steps by hand (this just sets up the node to help you)
5. I used CentOS 7
6. You will be running the `openshift-install` command from this helpernode

It's important to note that you can delegate DNS to this helpernode if you don't want to use it as your main DNS server. You will have to delegate `$CLUSTERID.$DOMAIN` to this helper node.

For example; if you want a `$CLUSTERID` of **ocp4**, and a `$DOMAIN` of **example.com**. Then you will delegate `ocp4.example.com` to this helpernode.

## Prereqs

> **NOTE** If using RHEL 7, you will need to enable the `rhel-7-server-rpms` and the `rhel-7-server-extras-rpms` repos. [EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) is also recommended for RHEL 7.

Install a CentOS 7 server with this recommended setup:

* 4 vCPUs
* 4 GB of RAM
* 30GB HD
* Static IP

Then prepare for the install

```
yum -y install ansible git
git clone https://github.com/christianh814/ocp4-upi-helpernode
cd ocp4-upi-helpernode
```

## Setup your Environment Vars

Inside that dir there is a [vars.yaml](docs/examples/vars.yaml) file ... **__modify it__** to match your network (the example one assumes a `/24`)

> **NOTE** See the `vars.yaml` [documentaion page](docs/vars-doc.md) for more info about what it does.


## Run the playbook

Once you edited your `vars.yaml` file; run the playbook

```
ansible-playbook -e @vars.yaml tasks/main.yml
```

## Helper Script

You can run this script and it's options to display helpful information about the install.

```
/usr/local/bin/helpernodecheck
```

## Install OpenShift 4 UPI

Now you're ready to follow the [OCP4 UPI install doc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.html#ssh-agent-using_installing-bare-metal)
